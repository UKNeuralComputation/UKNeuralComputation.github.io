## Conference venue

The conference will take place in The Diamond, 32 Leavygreave St, Sheffield S3 7RD, a short walk from Sheffield City Centre. We will be on the lower level, where we have access to lecture theatres and space for the poster sessions.

See map below for details.

## Getting to Sheffield and the venue

Sheffield is well connected by train to most hotbeds of computational neuroscience in the UK. Specifically, there are direct trains to London, Bristol, Oxford, Nottingham, Manchester, and Edinburgh.

The conference venue is a 25 minute walk, or an 8 minute taxi ride from the station. You can also take the tram (blue line, direction: Malin Bridge) to the University of Sheffield tram stop. To take the tram you will need to exit the train station at the back (over the pedestrian bridge across the tracks).
