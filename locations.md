## Conference venue

The conference will take place in **The Diamond, 32 Leavygreave St, Sheffield S3 7RD**, a short walk from Sheffield City Centre. We will be on the lower level, where we have access to lecture theatres and space for the poster sessions.

See map below for details.

Note that the ECR workshop Monday session will take place in a different venue closeby. We will be in the Pam Liversidge Building in rooms F12/F13. Enter the building at the corner of Broad Lane and Newcastle St. See the information that has been emailed to ECR attendees for further information.

## Getting to Sheffield and the venue

Sheffield is well connected by train to most hotbeds of computational neuroscience in the UK. Specifically, there are direct trains to London, Bristol, Oxford, Nottingham, Manchester, and Edinburgh.

The conference venue is a 25 minute walk, or an 8 minute taxi ride from the station. You can also take the tram (blue line, direction: Malin Bridge) to the University of Sheffield tram stop. To take the tram you will need to exit the train station at the back (over the pedestrian bridge across the tracks).

## Accommodation

The conference venue is easily reachable by foot from anywhere in Sheffield City Centre, which offers a number of hotels across different price ranges, including the [Leopold Hotel](https://www.leopoldhotel.co.uk/en/) (10 minutes walk), the [Mercure St Paul's](https://all.accor.com/hotel/6628/index.en.shtml) or the [Novotel](https://all.accor.com/hotel/1348/index.en.shtml) (both 20 minutes walk). Budget accommodation is available at [Jonas](https://www.jonashotel.co.uk/) for Â£50 per night. These are university managed former student accommodation, roughly 30 minutes walk from the conference venue.
