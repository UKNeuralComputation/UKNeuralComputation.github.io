UKNC2024 is being organised for 9-10 July 2024 at the University of Sheffield. Details will follow soon!

# About the meeting

A national meeting for the UK community working on the computational side of neuroscience. Be it modelling, maths, data science, theory, machine-learning, and all combinations thereof. 

Our programme will showcase the breadth and depth of UK computational work, from the single synapse and single neuron, through ensembles, networks, and circuits, up to the large-scale functional networks in the human brain.
